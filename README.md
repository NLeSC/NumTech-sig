Special Interest Group on Numerical Techniques

The Numerical Technique SIG of the Netherlands eScience Center, collaboratively explore and and develops methods to solve numerical problems. These problems range from, eigenvalue solvers, linear systems, differential equations .... We meet a couple of times a month to discuss recent developments, and/or have hands on sessions where we improve codes, develop new ones and learn about new techniques.
