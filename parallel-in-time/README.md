# Parallel in time methods

A selection of resources:

- [My parareal code](https://github.com/NLESC-JCER/parareal): This is still a work in progress.
- [Martin Gander's paper](https://www.unige.ch/~gander/Preprints/50YearsTimeParallel.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn5vqN8ezuE)
- [Parallel in time central](https://www.parallel-in-time.org/) contains links to the other codes I mentioned.
